# Roadmap

## Supported Features (v0.0.3)
- [x] Key Generation (CGGMP21 4-round)
- [x] Threshold Signing (CGGMP21 5-round)
- [x] Key Refresh (CGGMP21 4-round)
- [x] `secp256k1` Curve Support

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Completeness
- [ ] Key Resharing (Changing the committee or threshold)
- [ ] Presigning (Offline preprocessing for faster signing)
- [ ] Identification Protocol (ZKP for key ownership)

### Phase 2: Optimization
- [ ] 1-Round KeyGen (using simpler assumptions)
- [ ] Batch Signing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 3: Ecosystem
- [ ] WebAssembly (WASM) support
- [ ] Mobile bindings (iOS/Android)
